# morseCoder
Hello everybody,

I made a project which is about morse code in C++ language.
I created my library and used them.

Enter a message and then you will hear a morse alphabets sounds.

Note: .h files belong to header files. .cpp files belong to source code files. And also you should copy that extensions to visual studio and excract soundOfAlphabet files to main code area.
